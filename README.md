Full rewrite of my old voice select mod using magikoopa with more features

## Overview
A full rework of my voice select mod with more features and greater compatibility with other mods.  
This version has 2 major features over the original mod
- Voice names are now pulled from the asset data instead of the gamedata.
- New Settings option to control when the voice lines places, Every turn, Once a Turn, or Never.

## Installation
- Download the lastest release from the GameBanana Page or the Release tab here
- Extract the mod to your root title ID directory
- To make sure it's installed correctly there should be a romfs folder, the code.bps, and exheader.bin
Note: if your cpde.bps and exheader.bin are inside your romfs this mod will not load, makes sure they are outside the romfs.

## Building
\* Requires my fork of [Magikoopa](https://github.com/VelouriasMoon/Magikoopa) \*
- Download the source code from this page
- Added the code.bin and exheader.bin in the project folder where it says
- Set Working Directory in Magikoopa to the project folder
- Click the "Make and Insert" button
- Copy the mod files and the new Code.bin and exheader.bin to your title ID folder
